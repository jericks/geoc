geoc is a geospatial command line application that follows the unix philosophy. Each command does one thing well (buffer a layer, crop a raster) by reading a vector layer as a CSV text stream or a raster layer as an ASCII grid, processing the layer or raster, and then writing out the vector layer as a CSV or a raster layer as an ASCII grid. Individual commands can be chained together with unix pipes.
